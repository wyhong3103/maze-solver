# Maze Solver

This is essentially a project I've always wanted to do like a very long time ago, but at that time, I have no idea how to do this. And today, I've finally decided to do it, with the knowledge of manipulating the DOM and some tree traversal algorithms, both Depth First Search and Breadth First Search algorithms were involved in this project. Feel free to play around with it, might update it with greater algorithms in the future!And I realized that it doesn't always generate great maze, some of them just seems too easy, maybe is the algorithm I've used is too simple, anyways, it was fun!
